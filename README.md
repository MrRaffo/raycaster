A raycasting graphics system, similar to that used in Wolfenstein3d

4 versions of the raycaster exist in the folders v1-v4:

v1 - first attempt, displays a simple, low resolution pseudo 3d scene
v2 - second attempt, cleaner implementation of code
v3 - texture mapping implemented, using code-generated textures
v4 - texture mapping using hand-drawn textures designed with another program specifically for this task, 'texedit'
